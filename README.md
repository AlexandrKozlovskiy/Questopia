## QuestPlayAndroid (fork **[QuestPlayer](https://github.com/seedhartha/QuestPlayer)**)

Android application for launching text format games [QSP](https://github.com/seedhartha/qsp).

**This fork was made WhoYouAndM3. The original project (hereinafter **[QuestPlayer](https://github.com/seedhartha/QuestPlayer)**) with an no license does not bear any responsibility for this fork **[QuestPlayAndroid](https://github.com/l3ger0j/QuestPlayer.git)**.**

The differences between this fork and the parent fork are the same, except:
1. Updating dependencies to current versions;
2. Added the ability to "disable" the separator
3. Added a separate ProgressDialog for downloading game and for loading list games
4. Added the "fork" item in "About Quest Player Android"


## Future plans

- [] Improved RecyclerView + ActionMode + FAB (this will improve navigation in the application) + Multiple styles;
- [] Saving the state when turning the smartphone (i don't even know how to do it, so this is the most difficult point);
- [] To implement the ability to connect a plugin to download a list of games (also quite a difficult point, because I have no experience using, for example, AIDL);
- [] Implement downloading icons and text descriptions for games installed locally (for which me will need to implement the previous paragraph, lol);
- [] Move the entire native part to the plugin (to make it easier to update it).
